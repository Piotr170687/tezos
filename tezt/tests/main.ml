(* This module runs the tests implemented in all other modules of this directory.
   Each module defines tests which are thematically related,
   as functions to be called here. *)

(* Note: it is a good idea to have each module tag all of its tests with
   the module name. For instance, all tests implemented in [bootstrap.ml]
   have tag ["bootstrap"]. This allows to run only those tests easily. *)
